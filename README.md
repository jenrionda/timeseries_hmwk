# Time Series Analysis Conclusions
* Return Forecasting: Read Historical Daily Yen Futures Data
** We can see a long-term strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the Dollar. There do seem to be some more medium, 1-3 year consistent trends, but on a daily basis, there are a lot of short-term ups and downs.

* Return Forecasting: Initial Time-Series Plotting
** Do you see any patterns, long-term and/or short? 
*** We can see a long-term strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the Dollar. There do seem to be some more medium, 1-3 year consistent trends, but on a daily basis, there are a lot of short-term ups and downs.

* Decomposition Using a Hodrick-Prescott Filter
** Smoothing with the HP Filter and plotting the resulting trend against the actual futures returns, we can see that there's a lot of short term fluctuations that deviate around this trend. Perhaps these would represent profitable trading opportunities: For example, when the blue line deviates far below the orange, we can see this as a sign that the Yen is temporarily more undervalued than it should be (and, therefore, we'd see this as a short-term buying opportunity).

* Forecasting Returns using an ARMA Model
** Based on the p-value, is the model a good fit?

* Volatility Forecasting with GARCH
** Based on the p-values, is the model a good fit (p < 0.05)?

* Forecasting the Settle Price using an ARIMA Model
** What does the model forecast will happen to the Japanese Yen in the near term?

* Conclusions
** Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

** Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

** Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
